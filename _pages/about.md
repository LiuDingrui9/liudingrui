I am now a postgraduate student from [School of life science](https://lifesciences.sysu.edu.cn/),[Sun Yat-sen_University], majoring in Biology. My research interests primarily lie in the application of bioinformatics in animal breeding. I have participated in several relevant research  projects and published several articles during my postgraduate times.

Currently,I am working on projects related to genome-wide association study and transcriptome study on fish breeding. Looking forward, I will be a Ph.D. candidate at Westlake University in biology in Fall 2024.You can find my CV here:[Dingrui's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/LIUDINGRUI CV.pdf). If you are interested in my work, please feel free to drop me an email.
